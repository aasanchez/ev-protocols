# Scope

This document defines the protocol used between a **Charge Point** and **Central System**. If the protocol requires a
certain action or response from one side or the other, then this will be stated in this document.

The specification does not define the communication technology. Any technology will do, as long as it supports TCP/IP
connectivity.
