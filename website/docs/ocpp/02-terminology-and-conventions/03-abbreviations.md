OCPP 1.6 introduces new features to accommodate the market: Smart Charging, OCPP using JSON over Websockets, better
diagnostics possibilities (Reason), more Charge Point Statuses and TriggerMessage. OCPP 1.6 is based on OCPP 1.5, with
some new features and a lot of textual improvements, clarifications and fixes for all known ambiguities. Due to
