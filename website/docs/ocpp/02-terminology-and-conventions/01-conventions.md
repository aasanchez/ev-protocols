# Conventions

he key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt),
subject to the following additional clarification clause:

The phrase "valid reasons in particular circumstances" relating to the usage of the terms "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", and "NOT RECOMMENDED" is to be taken to mean technically valid reasons, such as the absence of necessary
hardware to support a function from a charge point design: for the purposes of this specification it specifically
excludes decisions made on commercial, or other non-technical grounds, such as cost of implementation, or likelihood of
use.

All sections and appendixes, except "Scope" and "Terminology and Conventions", are normative, unless they are
explicitly indicated to be informative.
