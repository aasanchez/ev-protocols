# Supported Topologies

OCPI started as a bilateral protocol, for peer-to-peer communication. Soon parties started to use OCPI via Hubs, but
OCPI 2.1.1 and earlier were not designed for that. OCPI 2.2 introduced a solution for this: message routing.

OCPI 2.2 introduced Platforms that connect via OCPI instead of CPO and eMSP, more on this in: EV Charging Market Roles
