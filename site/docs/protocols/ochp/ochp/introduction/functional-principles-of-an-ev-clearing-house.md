# Functional principles of an EV Clearing House

As an intermediate between two independent roaming partners, a clearing 
house serves to simplify and unify the data connection. There are few 
main principles, the business logic of a clearing house for electric 
mobility should follow. Those basic rules are:

* *Transparency* The existence of a clearing house should be 
  completely transparent for the EV user. The roaming connection 
  between an operator and a provider may or may not be routed through 
  a clearing house.
* *Independence* Roaming connections between two roaming partners and 
  their business models or tariffs should not be influenced by the 
  logic of the clearing house.
* *Anonymity*    The clearing house should require as little private 
  user data as possible.

OCHP supports those basic principles and aims to be capable to any 
business model following them.
